# Introducing myself

Hello, I guess the most important thing right now would be to introduce myself to the new blog. My name is Talon Peterson and I live in Missouri,
I currently attend high school so yes I am basically a child; but alas I am a child with large dreams.

This blog will be for updates on my personal projects as well as projects I work on with my peers. I beleive this is very important as to document my
way through early adulthood and hopefully much farther. 

Currently I dont have any projects that I am far enought progressed in to display them here so this will sit until I decide to make any updates.
